<p class="message">
  I'm John Le, a co-founder at <a href="https://www.statwing.com">Statwing</a>, part of a company summer camp batch in 2012 (YC).
  I'm using this blog as a sandbox for small experiments. Particularly with
  code, data, visualization, statistics, or whatever else I find
  interesting.
